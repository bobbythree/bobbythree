### I love JavaScript and I don't care who knows it!

I especially have an affinity for building things with Vanilla JS with minimal use of frameworks/libraries. This has afforded me insight into how things work on a deeper level as we all as achieve a greater understanding of the JavaScript language itself. I can use frameworks (I love Svelte/Sveltekit!), but I have very much enjoyed building things from scratch such as HTML Canvas Animations, webpages/web apps, games, and audio software. I like to build things that enrich my life-long experience as a visual artist and a musician while at the same time I just love solving problems and writing code.

Most recently, I have been working on a text parser for adventure games and also exploring NodeJS, ExpressJS and mySQL.

I am looking to join a team as a frontend dev, backend web dev, or even a database programmer. I code for the love of it but I am ready to make a career out of it. I feel it's time to use my skills toward making a meaningful contribution to a company and its consumers. Let's make it happen!
